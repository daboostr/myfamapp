# Feature Specification: M365-Style OneDrive Photo Sharing Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-m365-style`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a modern, sleek photo sharing website using OneDrive.  The user logins using their Microsoft ID.  Once logged in, a MS Graph queries for Onedrive files shared with me.  The page will organize the results from the graph query by grouping by people in one panel and show a gallery of images shared by those people.  Make it modern and use UI components that look like a modern M365 application."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
	- User types and permissions
	- Data retention/deletion policies  
	- Performance targets and scale
	- Error handling behaviors
	- Integration requirements
	- Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a person signed in with their Microsoft account, I want to see photos that others have shared with me in Microsoft cloud storage, organized by the people who shared them, so that I can quickly browse images from specific people in a modern, familiar (M365-style) interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given I am not signed in, when I open the site and select "Sign in", then I am prompted to authenticate with my Microsoft account and returned to the site in a signed-in state.
2. Given I am signed in and have items shared with me, when the site loads, then I see a left panel listing distinct people who have shared items with me and a gallery showing images from the selected person.
3. Given I am viewing the gallery for a selected person, when I choose a different person in the panel, then the gallery updates to show only that person's shared images.
4. Given I click an image in the gallery, when the image opens, then I can view a larger preview with key details (name, who shared it, date shared) and an option to open it in the source application in a new tab.
5. Given there are many shared images, when I scroll the gallery, then additional images load without freezing the page and basic performance is maintained.
6. Given there are no images shared with me, when the site loads, then I see a friendly empty state explaining there are no shared photos and offering guidance.
7. Given an image is no longer available to me, when the site attempts to display it, then I see an unobtrusive error indicator and the image is skipped or replaced by a placeholder.
8. Given I want to end my session, when I select "Sign out", then my session is terminated and I return to the unsigned state.

### Edge Cases
- Items shared with me include many non-image files ‚Üí Only supported image types are shown in the gallery; others do not appear.
- Very large result sets (e.g., thousands of images) ‚Üí The gallery remains responsive via incremental loading; counts are approximate if needed.
- People with the same display name ‚Üí Distinguish with additional context (e.g., email) where available.
- Shared items revoked after initial load ‚Üí The UI reflects updated availability without blocking interaction.
- Network or service throttling ‚Üí The UI shows a retry affordance and continues to function for other interactions.
- Multi-tenant accounts (work vs. personal) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which Microsoft account types are in scope?]
- Thumbnail availability varies by item [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum image formats and fallback behavior].

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The system MUST allow users to authenticate with their Microsoft account before accessing shared photos.
- FR-002: The system MUST retrieve the set of items that have been shared with the signed-in user from Microsoft cloud storage.
- FR-003: The system MUST restrict the displayed content to images only (e.g., common photo formats) and exclude non-image files from the gallery view.
- FR-004: The system MUST group shared images by the people who shared them and present a selectable list/panel of those people.
- FR-005: The system MUST display a gallery of images for the currently selected person, with thumbnails and basic details (e.g., file name).
- FR-006: The system MUST provide a clear way to change the selected person and update the gallery accordingly.
- FR-007: The system MUST provide an option to open an image in the source application in a new browser tab/window.
- FR-008: The system MUST provide an empty state when no shared images are available to display.
- FR-009: The system MUST provide a loading state while data is being fetched and avoid blocking the entire UI during long operations.
- FR-010: The system MUST handle access errors for individual items gracefully without failing the entire view.
- FR-011: The system MUST present a modern, Microsoft 365‚Äìstyle visual experience consistent with a professional, sleek interface.
- FR-012: The system MUST support responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- FR-013: The system MUST provide keyboard-navigable UI and visible focus states for all interactive elements.
- FR-014: The system MUST ensure text alternatives for non-decorative images (e.g., thumbnails) where applicable.
- FR-015: The system MUST provide a sign-out action that ends the user session and returns to the unsigned state.
- FR-016: The system SHOULD allow sorting and/or filtering of the gallery by at least "Most recent" and "Name" [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact sort/filter options].
- FR-017: The system SHOULD provide a basic search across image names within the selected person [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: search scope and matching].
- FR-018: The system SHOULD display an approximate count of images per person in the people panel if it does not impact performance.
- FR-019: The system SHOULD load images incrementally (e.g., pages or batches) to maintain responsiveness for large collections.
- FR-020: The system MUST not persist or expose photo content beyond what is necessary to present the gallery to the signed-in user.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- Person (Sharer): Represents an individual who has shared items with the user; includes human-friendly identifier(s) such as display name and, when available, contact information used only for disambiguation in the UI.
- Shared Image: Represents an image item shared with the user; includes user-visible name, a way to render a small preview/thumbnail, the person who shared it, and basic timestamps (e.g., date shared).
- People Grouping: Logical grouping that maps each Person (Sharer) to a collection of Shared Images for display and navigation.
- Session: Represents the signed-in state of the current user, including authorization to view items shared with them; does not include or store credentials.
