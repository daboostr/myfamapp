  "description": "I am building a modern, sleek photo sharing website using OneDrive. The user logins using their Microsoft ID. Once logged in, a MS Graph queries for OneDrive files shared with me. The page organizes the results from the graph query by grouping by people in one panel and shows a gallery of images shared by those people. Make it modern and use UI components that look like a modern M365 application.",
